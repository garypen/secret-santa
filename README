# secret-santa

Given a set of names/email addresses choose giver/receiver combinations
whilst guaranteeing that there are no directly reciprocal combinations.

The participants are provided in a file with the following format:

<name>:<email address>

The parser is very simple, so don't put in spaces or try to comment out
lines. Maybe that is an area worth improving...

Each partipant receives an email indicating who they should buy a present
for.

The -e option is used to send a mail containing all pairings to the
supplied address. This is so that an (presumably non-participating)
examiner can ensure that the program is working correctly.

The -o option specifies the mail address to use as the sender of the mail.

The -s option specifies the mail server to be used when sending the mail.

The -t option is used for testing. If this option is supplied, the emails
are not sent to the designated givers, but are instead sent to the
supplied address.

## Usage

secret-santa -s --server <email host> -o --originator <email address> \
  [-e --examiner <email address>] [-t --tester <email address>] <filename>

e.g:

Send mail from the server <server.com> as user <sender@server.com> with a
verification copy to verifier "verify@verify.com".

secret-santa -s server.com -o sender@server.com -e verify@verify.com data
